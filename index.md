# API Reference

The Postodian API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The JSON format ensures maximum compatibility with industry-standard web application frameworks and programming languages. Using the POST method, you can perform requests and retrieve data using the GET method.

## API Key

A unique API key is assigned to you during registration. It is your gateway to interact with Postodianâ€™s API endpoints. Use your key to authenticate all your requests using one of the [two authentication methods](/docs/authentication).

The key can be reset anytime from within your dashboard. This can be useful in the event that your key has been compromised. Please mind that resetting a key can break your application if it is not updated there at the same time.
